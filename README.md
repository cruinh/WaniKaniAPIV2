# WaniKaniAPIV2
Swift 4.0 Networking code and Codable data structures for WaniKani's v2 REST API.t

Note: this has so far been developed exclusively in the Swift Playgrounds 2 iOS app (Beta 6).  This is why all the code is currently in one file.  It's pretty darn difficult right now to use multiple source files in the app.  I'll organize things better eventually if I have time.
